# Cab-Service-Analytics

The biggest challenge for a given taxi service company is to increase the utilization rate of their cabs. However, the
demand keeps fluctuating based on the area, time of day, etc. The task is to device a geo-surge strategy that would help them incentivize their drivers. Identify what areas and at what times get most bookings and how would you increase the price in those areas in order to
meet the demand. More than any other task, it will be critical to get a deep understanding of the dataset,
the business and how you can help them.

This repository contains solution to the given task along with the dataset and a formal documentation consisting the approach of the same.
